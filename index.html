            I'm a software engineer by profession, mostly developing websites
            but also working on mobile apps and games.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now, I'm on a working holiday in New Zealand and loving every
            second of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I usually browse the internet or watch shows. When
            the weather's good, I like to go hiking or skiing, depending on the
            season.

                Rebuilt the old website for Hanmer Woolshed, which led to their

                reach beyond the domestic market.

          I'm currently based in Whangarei and happy to help with any of your
          software needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest service I offer is building a basic, single-page website
          with minimal ongoing costs (near-zero less domain renewal fee) for a
          one-time fee of $500.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>How can there be almost no ongoing costs?</summary>
          <p>
            It's possible by choosing the right platform for hosting your
            website. I can help set up the accounts you'll need so that
            afterwards, you'll be able to make changes to the site yourself.
            <i>This means you'll fully own your own website.</i>
          </p>
        </details>

        <p>
          If you need something more complex, other types of software, or just
          general tech advice, we can always chat and figure things out.
        </p>
